## Static

- Q-EXE-001. FMT-EXE-001, FMT-EXE-002, FMT-EXE-003, FMT-EXE-004,
  FMT-EXE-005: How does the overlay manager load an overlay? Which code
  reads the pack header and the segment table, what do the descriptor words
  `unk_02` and `unk_06` and the `flags` values 0, 1 and 4 mean, what does the
  `INT 3Fh` trap do with a trampoline's `target`, what fills the overlay
  header's zero fields at run time, and how are the fixups applied? Settles
  it: the `INT 3Fh` handler that the startup code installs, read through its
  file reads, the header fields it writes and the fixup loop. Tried: the only
  resident routine that calls both literal DOS seek and read wrappers
  (FND-EXE-007), which reads signature-and-length records and takes no pack
  input. Blocks: none.

- Q-EXE-005. FMT-EXE-006: Which code page interprets the disc sound helper's
  display bytes? Settles it: direct interpreter configuration or code-page/font
  selection evidence that distinguishes compatible decoders. Tried: all bytes
  profiled (FND-EXE-008); the high-byte set does not select a unique code page.
  Split from Q-EXE-002. Blocks: original display encoding identification.

- Q-EXE-006. FMT-EXE-006: How does the supported interpreter handle the
  undefined jump labels and colon-suffixed target in the disc sound helper?
  Settles it: static reading of the actual interpreter's label matching and
  error paths, with an owner observation only for environment-dependent
  behavior. Tried: complete label and jump reading (FND-EXE-009); the file
  cannot decide how the shell interprets those tokens. New reading:
  SRC-DOSBOX-GOG-0742 predicts literal trailing-colon matching and deletion
  of the active batch on a failed label search. Next static step: establish
  the relevant source-to-shipped-binary correspondence. FND-EXE-011 and
  FND-EXE-012 now locate compiled token normalization, search and conditional
  normal cleanup. FND-EXE-013 now reads the command-record consumer and its
  two-word call target. Next: trace batch-line production and the parser
  helper outputs into this input path, then external file helpers and
  exceptional cleanup. These partial direct readings do not establish the
  complete shell outcome.
  Blocks: complete shell outcome description.

- Q-EXE-007. FMT-EXE-006: Do the shipped game or sound-setup executables
  launch any batch helpers? Settles it: direct executable launch references
  traced through selectors and arguments, including computed command names.
  Tried: complete helper contents (FND-EXE-008) and distribution-wrapper
  reading (FND-EXE-010); neither locates an executable caller. Split from
  Q-EXE-004. Blocks: complete game/setup caller coverage.

- Q-EXE-008. FMT-EXE-006: Which disc helpers does the disc installer launch?
  Settles it: direct installer launch references and their selection inputs.
  Tried: helper contents and GOG wrapper (FND-EXE-008, FND-EXE-010), which
  do not cover the disc installer. Split from Q-EXE-004. Blocks: complete
  disc-installer caller coverage.

- Q-EXE-009. FMT-EXE-006: How does the shipped interpreter resolve the bare
  ravager/sound commands and continue after them in the declared GOG wrapper?
  Settles it: complete interpreter command-search, batch chaining and EXIT
  reading under declared working directory, mounts and configuration order;
  mutable overlay substitutions remain conditional. Tried: complete wrapper
  text (FND-EXE-010), bundled source lead (SRC-DOSBOX-GOG-0742), compiled
  dispatch/CALL and conditional batch replacement (FND-EXE-013, FND-EXE-014),
  local/PATH candidate order and the count-80 scan (FND-EXE-015, FND-EXE-016),
  initial selector production/writers and drive-command gates (FND-EXE-017,
  FND-EXE-018, FND-EXE-019), filename byte/component transformations and
  retained failure writes (FND-EXE-020, FND-EXE-021), and two pointer-installation
  paths with an object-plus-four prefix transfer (FND-EXE-022), and record
  append/growth arithmetic and publication boundaries (FND-EXE-023), and
  allocation/release import and local retry boundaries (FND-EXE-024), and
  failure-object prefix/bitmap fallback boundaries (FND-EXE-025), and a bounded
  append/initializer caller sequence (FND-EXE-026), and an earlier list producer
  with insertion before status dispatch (FND-EXE-027), and the bounded output
  table/default paths and shared reread (FND-EXE-028), and a shared helper
  sentinel-linked search (FND-EXE-029) and stored-length comparison
  operations (FND-EXE-030), a collection creation/link path (FND-EXE-031),
  signed field-publication branches (FND-EXE-032), and preceding-word addition
  helpers with distinct return contracts (FND-EXE-033), and negative-path
  payload-copy/length publication (FND-EXE-034), and storage capacity rounding
  and prefix initialization (FND-EXE-035), and the capacity-limit temporary
  construction/decrement/publication path (FND-EXE-036), and object
  first-word/payload-field construction order (FND-EXE-037), and temporary
  input/end production and range copying (FND-EXE-038), and null-input
  construction and failure publication (FND-EXE-039), and raw-prefix
  release forwarding (FND-EXE-040), and mutable final-target/import
  boundaries (FND-EXE-041), and encoded shared-record reading
  (FND-EXE-042), and shared-record initialization/publication
  (FND-EXE-043), and copied-tail/local-name termination
  (FND-EXE-044), and lazy initialization/record publication
  (FND-EXE-045), and mode admission/flag waiting
  (FND-EXE-046), and resource/helper-derived mode publication
  (FND-EXE-047), and exact record/wait imports and zero-result tail return
  (FND-EXE-048), and pre-helper saved-link cleanup through a fresh mode
  (FND-EXE-049), and construction-caller setup/cleanup return handling
  (FND-EXE-050), and recovered stored-handler prefixes and forwarding paths
  (FND-EXE-051), and selected-record publication and saved-state transfer
  (FND-EXE-052), and register-input selection with mutable-local traversal
  (FND-EXE-053), and second-selector callback order and distinct result gates
  (FND-EXE-054), and nested callback record writers and early status returns
  (FND-EXE-055), and selected-record access and wrapped field adjustments
  (FND-EXE-056), and signature-selected state and seven-return preparation
  (FND-EXE-057), and ordinary signed admission, iteration and six-return stores
  (FND-EXE-058), and matching byte consumption and terminating word outputs
  (FND-EXE-059), and metadata markers, cursor returns and relative targets
  (FND-EXE-060), and modifier mask classes, marker bypass and zero callees
  (FND-EXE-061), and guarded typed reads, zero bypass and cursor return
  (FND-EXE-062), and nibble-nine byte termination and sign-fill output
  (FND-EXE-063), and marker-stride matching, low-byte virtual-result publication
  and decoded-zero index scans (FND-EXE-064), and matching classification, opposite helper-result tests
  and full-word fallback flags (FND-EXE-065), and the second terminal wrapper, normal-return fallback
  and initial shared-target tail dispatch (FND-EXE-066). These bounded
  readings do not establish the complete shell outcome. Next: trace record
  construction and caller invariants, allocation callback/exceptional contracts, prefix
  length/storage/alias contracts, concrete
  vtable targets and remaining pointer/selector writers, then PATH admission,
  flag/EXIT continuations and declared mount/overlay inputs. Unread virtual
  and CRT effects stay conditional; truthy return is not proof of an update.
  Blocks: resolved wrapper-helper and continuation description.
