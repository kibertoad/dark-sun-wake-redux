### DATA-GOG-GFF-001 - GFF container directory

- **Question:** How are resource identities, offsets, and lengths represented in
  the owned build's `.GFF` containers?
- **Method:** Fingerprint the supported edition, inspect bounded header/index
  windows, compare the DSUN-MUSIC GFF results, implement an independently
  bounded reader, and enumerate metadata from every installed `.GFF` without
  retaining payload bytes.
- **Finding:** Version `0x00030000` uses a 28-byte header and little-endian
  primary/secondary tag tables as specified in `docs/ORIGINAL-FORMATS.md`.
  All 26 installed GFF files parse, producing 16,168 bounded descriptors.
- **Confidence:** verified for directory structure and counts in
  GOG-1432903719; tag payload semantics remain unknown unless separately
  recorded.
- **Implementation:** `DarkSunWakeRedux.Resources.GffArchive` and the read-only
  `DarkSunWakeRedux.Inspect gff` command.
- **Tests:** synthetic primary, primary-only, segmented-secondary, truncation,
  out-of-range, and partial-overlap cases.

### DATA-GOG-IMAGE-001 - Indexed images and palettes

- **Question:** Which bounded image and palette payload structures occur in the
  owned build's GFF resources?
- **Method:** Compare the DSUN-MUSIC image/palette research with bounded samples
  from the fingerprinted installation, independently implement defensive
  readers, and decode every matching resource in all 26 installed GFF files
  without retaining or committing decoded content.
- **Finding:** `BMP `, `CBMP`, and `ICON` share a framed indexed-image envelope
  with sparse-row, `PLAN`, and `PLNR` encodings. `PAL ` contains 256 three-byte
  VGA colors. The readers decode 4,510 images containing 9,279 frames and all
  40 palettes in the installed build.
- **Confidence:** verified for these payload structures and counts in
  GOG-1432903719; resource meaning, palette pairing, placement, and timing are
  still unknown.
- **Implementation:** `DarkSunWakeRedux.Resources.IndexedImage`,
  `IndexedPalette`, and the read-only `image-catalog` inspection command.
- **Tests:** synthetic row/planar decoding, transparency, palette conversion,
  and malformed size, bounds, component, and bitstream cases.

## Initial rules

### RULE-INPUT-001 - Mouse-first interaction

- **Behavior:** The original requires a mouse and uses cursor modes for walking,
  looking, attacking, and targeted actions. Escape exits the active menu.
- **Preconditions:** Relevant exploration or menu state is active.
- **Evidence:** MANUAL-1994, introduction and "How to Play".
- **Confidence:** high for intended behavior; exact hit regions and shipped edge
  behavior are unknown.
- **Implementation:** not implemented.
- **Tests:** planned semantic-input and menu-routing tests.
- **Uncertainty:** Cursor art, complete mode transitions, right-click behavior,
  and coordinate boundaries require OBS-GOG evidence.

### RULE-PARTY-001 - Four-character party

- **Behavior:** The creation flow accepts one to four characters and recommends
  four. An empty party cannot start and a fifth character cannot be added.
- **Evidence:** MANUAL-1994, quick-start and party-creation sections, pages 2 and
  7-9.
- **Confidence:** high for intended party bounds and flow.
- **Implementation:** deterministic Core party aggregate and validation result;
  start/menu presentation is not implemented.
- **Tests:** empty/one/four/fifth-member boundaries and invalid-character
  rejection.
- **Uncertainty:** Exact pregenerated party data, on-disk created-character
  format, cancellation state, and shipped edge behavior require observation.

### RULE-PARTY-002 - Character creation invariants

- **Behavior:** Creation offers human, dwarf, elf, half-elf, half-giant,
  halfling, mul, and thri-kreen. Muls are male and thri-kreen female in the
  creation flow. Characters use one of six good/neutral alignments, ability
  scores fall from 9 through 24, and each class has the documented ability
  minima. Humans begin single-classed; non-humans may select as many as three
  classes; cleric and druid cannot be combined.
- **Evidence:** MANUAL-1994, pages 7-9 and 16-23.
- **Confidence:** high for documented intent; not yet observed in the shipped
  build.
- **Implementation:** `PartyCreationRules` exposes stable diagnostics and
  rejects unsupported drafts without I/O or presentation dependencies.
- **Tests:** sex, alignment/enum, ability range and class minima, human
  multiclass, class count/duplicates, cleric+druid, and agreed eligibility
  constraints.
- **Uncertainty:** Initial HP adjustment, ability-generation distribution,
  racial adjustments during editing, valid multiclass combinations, and exact
  screen defaults need DATA-GOG/OBS-GOG evidence.

### CONFLICT-PARTY-001 - Manual race/class eligibility lists

- **Claim A:** The race descriptions list the classes allowed for each race.
- **Claim B:** The class descriptions independently list allowed races.
- **Conflict:** The lists disagree for half-giant ranger and thief, mul druid,
  and thri-kreen druid and thief. They may contain additional combination rules
  that prose alone does not expose.
- **Evidence:** MANUAL-1994, race descriptions on pages 17-18 and class
  descriptions on pages 19-22.
- **Implementation:** these pairs return `EvidenceConflict` and validation emits
  `class_race_unresolved`; no eligibility is guessed.
- **Resolution needed:** record the selectable class list for every race in the
  fingerprinted GOG build, then update the matrix and tests.

### RULE-COMBAT-001 - Party expansion on combat entry

- **Behavior:** Exploration may show only the leader; combat makes all four party
  members visible. The manual also documents wait, guard, target cycling, and
  end-turn commands.
- **Evidence:** MANUAL-1994, "How to Play" and hotkeys.
- **Confidence:** high for intended commands; resolution order and formulas are
  unknown.
- **Implementation:** not implemented.
- **Tests:** planned deterministic combat command traces.
- **Uncertainty:** Activation order, RNG, THAC0/AC details, timing, and difficulty
  effects require OBS-GOG and possibly targeted Ghidra evidence.

## Conflict handling

FAQ-81038 reports discrepancies between documentation and shipped behavior.
Each conflict receives its own rule ID, both claims, reproduction procedure, and
owner decision. No compatibility behavior is selected from plausibility alone.
