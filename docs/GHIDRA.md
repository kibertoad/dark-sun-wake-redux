# Ghidra setup for clean-room analysis

Ghidra is a recommended research tool for questions that the manual,
walkthrough, controlled play, and bounded data inspection cannot answer exactly.
Use it only against the repository owner's legally owned local executable.
Ghidra projects, binaries, byte dumps, screenshots, and full disassembly or
decompiler output must never be added to Git.

This workflow follows the established practice in
`C:\sources\rechaos-overlords`: fingerprint the executable first, keep a
disposable local analysis project, answer narrow questions with bounded scripts,
record address-level factual findings and confidence, then implement the behavior
independently with synthetic tests.

## Installed toolchain

The current research machine has:

| Tool | Version | Location |
|---|---|---|
| Ghidra | 12.1.3 | `C:\Users\kiber\AppData\Local\Programs\Ghidra\ghidra_12.1.3_PUBLIC` |
| Eclipse Temurin JDK | 21.0.12.1 | `C:\Users\kiber\AppData\Local\Programs\Java\jdk-21.0.12.1+1` |

Check `support\analyzeHeadless.bat` and `bin\java.exe` at these paths before
searching the machine or installing anything. A sandboxed process may need
permission to persist Ghidra preferences under the user profile; request that
narrow permission instead of reinstalling the toolchain.

## Reference executable

```text
C:\GOG Games\Dark Sun 2\DSUN.EXE
```

- Edition evidence: GOG product `1432903719`, installed build
  `52095422060333615`, English.
- Length: 634,416 bytes.
- SHA-256: `ce02ee1f31c2339fc3e16926e370639af782a5ecd6c8a6081140fa23445fc92c`.
- Evidence ID: `GOG-1432903719`.

Always verify length and SHA-256 before interpreting an address. Findings from a
different executable belong to a separate edition record and address map.

## When to use Ghidra

Use Ghidra after forming a narrow, player-visible question, for example:

- the exact order or boundary of a combat calculation;
- RNG algorithm, seeding, range conversion, or consumption order;
- the producer/consumer relationship for an evidenced GFF field;
- a quest flag transition or timer whose behavior conflicts across sources;
- lookup-table dimensions, sentinel values, or resource identifiers;
- the cause of a reproducible original defect that needs a fidelity decision.

Do not begin with unrestricted decompilation or a speculative attempt to recreate
the original source tree. Prefer runtime observation for presentation and data
inspection for self-describing resources. Static evidence is strongest when a
focused finding and a controlled observation agree.

## Headless workflow

Create a uniquely named disposable project below `%TEMP%` and import the
fingerprinted executable directly:

```powershell
$wakeGhidraHome = 'C:\Users\kiber\AppData\Local\Programs\Ghidra\ghidra_12.1.3_PUBLIC'
$wakeJavaHome = 'C:\Users\kiber\AppData\Local\Programs\Java\jdk-21.0.12.1+1'
$env:GHIDRA_HOME = $wakeGhidraHome
$env:JAVA_HOME = $wakeJavaHome
$env:Path = "$wakeJavaHome\bin;$wakeGhidraHome;$wakeGhidraHome\support;$env:Path"
$wakeProjectRoot = Join-Path $env:TEMP ('dark-sun-wake-ghidra-' + [guid]::NewGuid().ToString('N'))
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path $wakeProjectRoot | Out-Null
& "$wakeGhidraHome\support\analyzeHeadless.bat" `
  $wakeProjectRoot DarkSunWakeAnalysis `
  -import 'C:\GOG Games\Dark Sun 2\DSUN.EXE' `
  -overwrite
```

Retain that project only locally and reuse it for focused scripts:

```powershell
& "$wakeGhidraHome\support\analyzeHeadless.bat" `
  $wakeProjectRoot DarkSunWakeAnalysis `
  -process 'DSUN.EXE' `
  -noanalysis `
  -scriptPath "$PWD\tools\ghidra" `
  -postScript ReportFunctionSummary.java 0x00000000
```

The address above is intentionally a placeholder example, not a finding. Replace
it only with an address selected through an evidence-led query.

## Bounded script pattern

Adapt the reusable headless scripts and methodology from
`C:\sources\rechaos-overlords\tools\ghidra` or their shared upstream source;
do not copy game-specific findings. Preferred scripts are deliberately bounded:

- explicit byte-pattern searches capped to a reviewable result count;
- function summaries for a small explicit address list;
- references to explicit addresses or symbols;
- no more than 256 data bytes from one explicit address;
- scalar searches capped to a reviewable result count;
- string-reference searches using a specific known UI label or error message;
- decompiler literal matches within one selected function;
- a single basic-block-sized decompile window, never adjacent windows stitched
  into a retained function;
- short instruction context that cannot cross the containing function;
- call-site filtering using an exact callee and known scalar arguments.

Script output is temporary navigation evidence, not production input and not
proof by itself. Never redirect broad output into the repository.

## Evidence record

### EXE-GOG-UI-001 - APFM offset 88 is an event mask

- **Question:** Does the varying 16-bit `APFM` field at payload offset 88
  describe appearance, a resource, or dispatch behavior?
- **Target:** GOG-1432903719 `DSUN.EXE`, 634,416 bytes, SHA-256
  `ce02ee1f31c2339fc3e16926e370639af782a5ecd6c8a6081140fa23445fc92c`;
  Ghidra 12.1.3, 16-bit real-mode MZ loader, JDK 21.0.12.1.
- **Bounded finding:** Function `3d72:0515` compares the input tag with the
  little-endian `APFM` scalar at `3d72:0529`. At `3d72:054d` it bit-tests the
  word at structure offset `0x58` against a caller-supplied word, branches when
  no requested bit is present, and otherwise begins assembling a dispatch
  record containing the resource identity. This rejects an appearance/resource
  interpretation and supports an event-mask role.
- **Corroboration:** all 97 owned `APFM` records vary only at identity,
  dimensions, and offset 88; #19200/#19201 store masks 494/486. Those values do
  not resolve as resource numbers in `RESOURCE.GFF`.
- **Confidence:** high for event-mask role; unknown for individual bits.
- **Implementation:** `UiApplicationFrameResource.EventMask`, synthetic
  decoding test, and UI catalog output; no bit-level behavior is assigned.
- **Shared-layout corroboration:** the sibling dispatcher at `3d72:0fd4`
  verifies a `BUTN` tag and tests the same structure offset `0x58` against bit 4
  at `3d72:0fea`; its next `BUTN` branch tests bit 2 at `3d72:100e`.
  `UiButtonResource.EventMask` therefore preserves the same field.
- **Edit-box corroboration:** after verifying `EBOX` at `3d72:10b3`, the same
  dispatcher tests bit 2 at edit-box structure offset `0x96` at `3d72:10c1`.
  This is preserved as `UiEditBoxResource.EventMask`.
- **Mutation corroboration:** APFM helper `3f96:02f8` resolves the record by
  tag/identity, then mutates offset `0x58`: operation 1 ORs in the supplied
  bits, operation 2 ANDs with their complement, and operation 3 clears the
  word. This independently confirms mutable event registration rather than
  appearance data.
- **Matching rule:** handlers use nonzero bit intersection, implemented
  independently as `UiEventMasks.Matches`. Numeric bit meanings remain unnamed.

### EXE-GOG-UI-002 - WIND image field is not a generic background command

- **Question:** Does the nonzero resource number at WIND payload offset 58
  (`0x3a`) tell the generic window engine to tile or stretch that image as the
  window background?
- **Target:** GOG-1432903719 `DSUN.EXE`, 634,416 bytes, SHA-256
  `ce02ee1f31c2339fc3e16926e370639af782a5ecd6c8a6081140fa23445fc92c`;
  Ghidra 12.1.3, 16-bit real-mode MZ loader, JDK 21.0.12.1.
- **Bounded finding:** the resource resolver's exact `WIND` branch at
  `39d1:04bc` searches a dedicated linked registry by identity at structure
  offset 8 and link at `0xee`. Complete bounded inspection of registration
  `3a8e:02b3`, redraw `3a8e:0003`, and activation `3a8e:060d` found no read of
  offset `0x3a`. Registration resolves each child by its tag and identity;
  redraw restores/clips registered rectangles; activation invokes an optional
  callback and then dispatches the resolved children.
- **Interpretation:** the generic WIND path does not establish `BMP` #19004 as
  an automatic tiled, stretched, or full-window background. The field may be
  consumed by screen-specific code or may serve another role. Both remain open.
- **Corroboration:** all six start-flow WIND records carry #19004 although the
  observed start window instead composes `BMP` #20029, #20028, and four controls
  over black; #19004 itself is only 96x9.
- **Confidence:** high for absence from the inspected generic path; unknown for
  the field's actual presentation role.
- **Implementation consequence:** preserve the resource identity in DSUI and
  the extracted DSIX asset, but do not tile, stretch, or draw it until an
  app-specific consumer or controlled observation establishes the operation.

### EXE-GOG-UI-003 - Party surface delegates slot meaning to application logic

- **Question:** Does the single full-canvas control under `WIND` #19502 expose
  the character-slot hit regions or semantic actions used by the party screen?
- **Target:** GOG-1432903719 `DSUN.EXE`, 634,416 bytes, SHA-256
  `ce02ee1f31c2339fc3e16926e370639af782a5ecd6c8a6081140fa23445fc92c`;
  Ghidra 12.1.3, 16-bit real-mode MZ loader, JDK 21.0.12.1.
- **Bounded finding:** owned data inspection establishes that `WIND` #19502
  contains only image-less, event-mask-zero `BUTN` #2099 at (0,0), sized
  319x199. Exact scalar searches for 19502 and 2099 found no executable use.
  The generic window registry at `3a8e:02b3` clears optional callback fields at
  runtime offsets `0xf9` and `0xfd` (`3a8e:05d5`/`05df`). Activation
  `3a8e:060d` tests/calls `0xfd` at `06fa`/`0707`, dispatches resolved children,
  then tests/calls `0xf9` at `08aa`/`08b7`. A whole-program structure-offset
  query found only those reads, the registry clears, and generic setters at
  `3a8e:0d0c`/`0d3c`; the sole direct activation caller is the registered-window
  scan at `3a8e:1048` (`107a`).
- **Interpretation:** the serialized graph establishes one application surface,
  not the internal party-slot rectangles or their actions. Those semantics are
  installed or dispatched indirectly at runtime and remain unknown; panel art
  alone is insufficient evidence for hit boundaries.
- **Confidence:** high for the serialized surface, generic callback lifecycle,
  and absence of the two direct scalar constants; unknown for the application
  callback and slot partition.
- **Implementation consequence:** validate the exact 319x199 exclusive surface
  from DSUI and keep it semantically inert until controlled observation or a
  bounded indirect-call finding establishes the slot partition and actions.

### EXE-GOG-CHAR-001 - No adjacent default-party identity table established

- **Question:** Does the supported executable contain either disc character
  block #40-#43 or #50-#53 as an adjacent default-party lookup table?
- **Target:** GOG-1432903719 `DSUN.EXE`, reverified at 634,416 bytes with SHA-256
  `ce02ee1f31c2339fc3e16926e370639af782a5ecd6c8a6081140fa23445fc92c`;
  Ghidra 12.1.3, 16-bit real-mode MZ loader, JDK 21.
- **Bounded finding:** exact four-byte and eight-byte little-endian searches
  found no #40-#43 sequence and no 16-bit representation of either block. Two
  four-byte #50-#53 matches at `5000:a368` and `5000:a379` lie inside the
  executable's upper- and lower-case hexadecimal digit strings, not a character
  table. The apparent matches were therefore rejected.
- **Corroboration:** `DATA-GOG-CHAR-006` establishes that both blocks occur on
  the disc and that one independently reported default member maps to #43, but
  does not establish the remaining selection.
- **Confidence:** high for rejecting these exact adjacent-table encodings;
  unknown for an indirect, computed, flagged, or non-adjacent selection.
- **Implementation consequence:** no default-party mapping is derived from this
  query. `ReportBytePattern`, `ReportDataBytes`, `ReportReferences`, and
  `ReportScalarConstants` retain bounded, reusable navigation methods for later
  evidence questions.

For each useful finding, add a concise entry here or in the relevant
`docs/RULES-AND-EVIDENCE.md` / `docs/ORIGINAL-FORMATS.md` section with:

- finding ID and the exact question asked;
- executable edition, length, and SHA-256;
- Ghidra and JDK versions plus load settings;
- virtual/file address or bounded address range and call relationship;
- observed constants, comparisons, reads/writes, and operation order described
  independently in our own words;
- competing interpretations and rejected hypotheses;
- confidence: `unknown`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, or `verified`;
- the controlled runtime observation or data fact used for corroboration;
- the production entry point and synthetic automated test, once implemented.

An interpretation remains provisional until independent evidence supports its
semantics. Ghidra's pseudocode can misidentify types, reuse variables, and fold
control flow; check instruction context when a conclusion depends on those
details.

## Clean-room boundary

- Never copy decompiled implementation, original names inferred only from debug
  remnants, or original control structure into production code.
- Implement factual behavior independently using repository-owned names and
  architecture.
- Keep `DSUN.EXE`, temporary projects, dumps, listings, and screenshots under
  ignored `analysis/original/`, `%TEMP%\dark-sun-wake-ghidra-*`, or another
  local-only path.
- Commit only independently written findings, bounded reusable scripts, and
  synthetic tests.
- A static finding may guide a parser or rule, but production code must never
  depend on an address or execute/load the original binary.
