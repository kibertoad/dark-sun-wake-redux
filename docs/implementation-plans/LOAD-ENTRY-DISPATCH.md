# Load-entry dispatch observation

Research tooling for Q-COMBAT-046; no rebuild behavior changes. The outcome
is an observed route from the verified two-character map checkpoint into
Load Game, without selecting a row or executing a numbered load.

Evidence: FND-SAVE-018's F2 route, FND-CONFIG-221/222's dispatch/count
contracts, FND-COMBAT-132's named UI fields, FND-COMBAT-081/085's mode and
selected-row consumers, and docs/RUNTIME.md's current Play checkpoint.

Restore only a strict pinned, executable-verified play-ready state whose
saved mapping and named fields admit the two-character map with leader 1.
Use the existing muted owned-session settings, private checkpoint drive,
read-only disc and session lock. Deliver only F2, with delivery recorded.
Break at resident 39D1:0752 and the guarded RNG entries; capture the 24-byte
by-value event at the dispatch entry's far-call argument frame. Observe the
named count/head, current event window/callback, global hooks, saved handler,
mirror, Save/Load pointer/mode, selected row/top, list pointer and exit byte.
All pointer reads use bounded real-mode reads and validate the window tag.
Never traverse the list graph, seed memory, invoke a function directly or
send a Load/Save confirmation. Unknown RNG callers and short/invalid reads
fail closed. State readiness, not elapsed time, admits Load window 18500.
Bound continuations and retain a diagnostic report on every failed predicate.
Original-derived events, frames, journals and checkpoints remain in GAME_DIR.

Synthetic controls: null and tagged event targets, bad tags, short reads,
real-mode wrapping, adjacent fields and wrong map/Load predicates. Reuse
the existing checkpoint evidence test suite. Run Test.ps1 with the affected
tooling suite before committing; runtime findings form a separate research
batch. A successful key operation alone proves delivery, not screen entry.

Exit: committed bounded probe and controls passing, with actual runtime
outcome retained locally. No queue closure, evidence promotion, native-saved
game capability, callback preservation or graph-membership proof follows
merely from a snapshot.
